<p>Hello! 👋 </p>

<p>I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Cincinnati, working under the guidance of Prof. Anil Jegga and
Prof. Ali
Minai. </p>

<p>
In my PhD research, I have been studying the capabilities of graph neural networks (GNN) in handling complex
networks,
primarily focusing on multimodal datasets. My published work includes in-depth analysis of biomedical
networks and
modeling them via graph neural networks. Furthermore, while working at Seagate, I evaluated the capabilities
and limitations of Transformers and convolutions in semicounductor (soft-sensing) data. This led me to
propose innovative approaches for addressing imbalanced time-series datasets.
</p>

<p>
In the moments I wrest from the fabric of time, I enjoy thinking about startups, economics, and humans in
space. For fun,
I build things 👨🏼‍💻, lift weights 🏋🏻‍♂️, watch movies 🍿, read books 📚, and practice guitar 🎸.
