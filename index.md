I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Sciences at the University of Cincinnati. My advisors are Dr. Anil Jegga and Dr. Ali A. Minai. My research interests are in graph neural networks, language models, knowledge representation learning, and computational drug discovery. 

My current PhD research goal is to build fundamental blocks to help shape the future of AI in pharmaceutical therapies. These blocks are primarily focused towards utilizing state-of-the-art AI/ML models to learn mono and multi-drug-therapy effects on patients. This encompasses training large language models on multi-modal chemical/biological data, building novel research pipelines for combinatorial drug discovery, and leveraging those techniques for discovering effective, but more importantly safe therapies towards rare diseases such as Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 

I achieved my Master's degree at the University of Cincinnati in December 2018 under the same advisors. During my Master's thesis, my research focussed on identifying and characterizing drug-drug interactions (DDI) using machine-learning methods. I conceived and developed a novel protocol by extracting, pre-processing and predicting DDI severity using drug annotation profiles and best performing machine learning algorithm.
